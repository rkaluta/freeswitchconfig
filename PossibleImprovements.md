# Possible Improvements #

There are a lot of possible ideas to add to this system to make it better, strong, faster and more extendable.  The problem is we need more developers to help with these ideas, both in developing and coming up with some.

Some of the ideas that have come up in conversations are:
  * Designing the system to handle the configuration of multiple servers, this requires a fair bit of recoding in the core to succeed which may require several developers to do.
  * Adding an SNMP module that monitors both freeswitch as well as the site itself and submits SNMP data
  * Cleanup code, improve performance on mobile browser support
